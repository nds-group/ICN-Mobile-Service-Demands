## Data

The file "Antennas_RSCA.csv" includes the computed RSCA of the 73 (columns) mobile services under consideration for the 4762 (rows) indoor cellular network antennas included in our data set
The file "RSCA_Outdoor_Antennas.csv" includes the computed RSCA of the 73 (columns) mobile services under consideration for the neighboring outdoor antennas found within a 1km radius from the ICN antennas
Access to raw traffic data can be provided upon agreement with the operator

### Methodology:

A hierarchical clustering algorithm is employed to identify the clusters of ICN antennas based on similarities and differences in the RSCA values that denote under- or over-utilization of the 73 mobile services at each antenna with respect to typical usages.

The clustering results are interpreted via SHAP and the clusters are juxtaposed with the type of indoor environment at which the antennas are installed.
